# 1. Consider the following sequence: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49.... The sequence
#    is simply the square of the natural numbers. Write a function that takes a
#    number as input and returns the sum of the above sequence up to that
#    index. For example, input 1, simply returns 1. input 2, returns 1 + 4 = 5.


# 2. Write a Python function that takes two lists of integers as input and
#    returns a list containing the intersection of the two lists.

# 3. Write a Python program that takes a string as input and counts the number
#    of vowels in the string.

# 4. The numerical value of a string is defined as the sum of all the numerical
#    values of its letters where a = 1, b =2, ..., z = 26. Write a Python
#    program that takes a string as input and returns the numerical value of the
#    string.

# 5. Write a class called Queue which implements a queue data structure with the
#    following methods:
#    Add(x) -> Insert the number x to the back of the queue.
#    Pop() --> Removes and returns the element at the front of the queue.
#    Size() --> Returns the current number of elements in the queue.
